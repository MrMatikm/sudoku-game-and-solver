# Sudoku game and solver
## Introduction
This application allows the user either to play Sudoku and try to solve it on their own or let the computer solve it and watch the animation of how the backtracking algorithm works.
I created this project because once I found out about the backtracking algorithm I wanted to apply it to something interesting like the Sudoku game.
## How to use
You can select a field by left clicking on it. Then type a number from 1 to 9 and press enter. If the number leads to a solution, the number will stay there and you won't be able to change it anymore. Simply select the next field with your mouse. If the number does not lead to a solution, the field will be cleared and you can try again.
If you want to let the computer solve the Sudoku, click the Solve button and watch the animation of a backtracking algorithm.
